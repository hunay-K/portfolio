To create his new series<br><br>The Moon is Rising , he recalled the waning of the moon over time and the multicolored<br>moonbows that form around the moon due to sunlight reflected off its surface.</p>

                                <h4>George Stubbs</h4>
                                <h3>Lion Attacking a Horse</h3>
                                <p>George Stubbs’s scene of a lion attacking a horse can be read as an allegory of<br>highly charged human interactions. This is the first of sixteen paintings by<br>the artist, including the Yale University Art Gallery’s version, to represent this theme.<br>Stubbs often painted domestic animals, but in expanding his practice in<br>1762 to depict wild animals, he became a leader in “sublime” themes in art.</p>
